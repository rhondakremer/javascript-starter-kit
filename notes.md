*********************************

## Editor Config
visit editorconfig.org to check if editor has built-in support, may need to download plugin

## Package Manager
there are more besides npm! Bower, JSPM, Jam, volo

## Development Web Server
six "interesting" options: http-server (super lightweight, no config, no live reloading), live-server, Express (production grade), budo, Webpack dev server (convenient if you're using webpack), Browsersync (dedicated IP! and different views will stay in sync)

Express is the only one listed that works for production

Express competitor: koa and hapi

sharing work in progress: localtunnel, ngroc, surge, now

## Automation
npm-run-all --parallel

## Transpiling
